# RedButtonAlerts
After working on our Hack with Heart Project, as a team, we realized we were passionate about building solutions to help students. After going to several workshops, we were inspired to integrate the Twilio API. Being students ourselves we understand our target market well. We wanted to help make the education system transparent between teachers and parents, by building a platform that fosters smooth, speedy, and safe communication.

## About the Project
Teachers are able to set an alert through the app. They first need to choose from the three options: lockdown, hold & secure, and immediate pickup. The teachers then have access to the database for all the contact information of the parents. From there they can send an SMS notification to parents and they can reply with a yes/no. This response is then updated in the database giving teachers information in real-time.

This project was built on Android Studio (Java) and integrated the beautiful *Twilio API* in order to send and receive SMS messages en masse.
